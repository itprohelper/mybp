# Flask app in order to help users track their blood pressure readings.
This repo uses my [Flask base repo](https://github.com/itprohelper/flask_base) which intends to make easier to setup a development using Docker.

## How to run this container?
Using your terminal go to the directory where you cloned this repo and then start the containers using [docker compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)

```bash
docker compose up
```

## More details are coming soon.
I also wrote some brief tutorials on different subjects hoping to help somebody.
